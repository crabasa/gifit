## Setup

You will need the following to get started:

* Ubuntu VPS
* Node.js

## Installation

On your Ubuntu VPS, grab the source code:

Change into the directory that was created and install the necessary modules:

`npm install`

Get the necessary binaries:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

Set-up some environment variables for your Node app:

```
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxx
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=yyy
```

Spin-up your Node server

Log-in to your Twilio account and edit an MMS-capable phone number. Set the Messaging Request URL to `http://yourhost:3000/message`. Make sure you select `HTTP GET`. Click "Save".
